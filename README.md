# non-programming-works-

Theses are some example works during my study at the University of Surrey. I did the International Business Strategy Report individually. It is about analysing a company's current situation and giving a strategic plan for expanding its business overseas by presenting data and information from diverse dimensions. The other two documents were group works. Tourism Data Analysis Poster is analysing a big data set of hotels in London during 2011-2016 to give recommendations. I cleaned the original data set, analysed it with software Tableau and made the diagrams. For the Sustainability report, my teammates and I worked together to assess EasyJet's sustainability practices and improvement.  

Note: All the works I uploaded here were worked based on documents and academic journals already published online, and do not contain any confidential business information.
